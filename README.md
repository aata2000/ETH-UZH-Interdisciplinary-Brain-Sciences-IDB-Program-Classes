Hi There,

My name is Ata and I joined the IDB program at ETH ZÃ¼rich/UZH in its inagural year. I wrote some lecture notes to help me study for important exams and I have added my notes to this repository. You can both download the notes and also import them to your own Overleaf project spaces to edit them and make them more detailed. Don't assume that they are 100% correct, there might be some inaccuracies.

Best wishes and good luck in your studies if you are doing the IDB program,

Ata
