I took Neuroeconomics taught by Professor Dr. Todd Hare in my first semester (Fall 2022) in the IDB Program. This class was an elective class. I enjoyed it very much and passed it with a 5.75/6.
Here, you can find the lecture notes I wrote as a pdf file.
The other folder contains the components that you can upload to Overleaf to edit and improve the notes. 

Best of luck in your studies,

Ata
